# Requirements

## What's up with `requirements.in` and `requirements_dev.in`?

They're the source for `requirements.txt` and `requirements_dev.txt` -- those are the compiled results of feeding `requirements.in` and `requirementst_dev.in` to pip-comiple.

## Advantages of pip-compiled requirements files.

* All dependencies are marked.  Allows one to clean out old, unneeded packages and their dependencies.
